The answer is simple: we earn money by showing ads in our apps, like most developers on Google Play.

Each view brings us a small amount of money from the advertiser. Click on the ad would get us more revenue, but please click on ads ONLY if you are genuinely interested in the product. False clicks will be detected and we wouldn’t get any payment for them.

We don’t want to spam users with unexpectable ads, so all ads in all our apps are called by the user only. 
If you want to change the color theme of the app (or change board size in 2048), you need to press a button on the bottom of the main screen – and that calls the ad.

In case you don’t have an internet connection, you can simply change the color theme (or change board size in 2048) without any ads.
